A Python library for being a CND Batman.

## Setup
You'll want to run ```script/bootstrap``` to pull down the GeoLiteCity database from [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home). In Linux (Ubuntu), you may need to install ```libgeoip-dev```.

## Tests
Super simple. After you've run ```python setup.py install```, just use ```script/test``` to run the test suite.
